I am Ugnius Malūkas, currently I am Entrepreneurial Engineering student at Aalborg University (Denmark). At the same time I work as Product Management Student Assistant at OBI+ startup. My current goal is to have deeper business and product development knowledge from managerial side.

I  also have a Bachelor in Software Engineering (Software Systems) from Kaunas University of Technology (Lithuania). My over 3 years of experience in Software Engineering and Software Development includes working in Automotive, Robotics and Telecommunication fields.

I am a generalist Software Engineer. In my opinion, every programming language brings its own advantages, that is why I stick more to a final result and requirements than a language itself. I am a fast-learner, hard worker and patient of solving “bugs” engineer. I love coding even in my spare time and, moreover, I contribute to open-source when I can.
